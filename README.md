Concentration
=============

Memory card game with user-friendly interface in which you must flip over matching pairs to score points.  Developed in C++ using UWO's CS1037 libraries and classes (Disclaimer: I do not own, nor did I develop any of the source files in the cs1037lib directory).

All game logic is implemented in the concentration-main.cpp file.
